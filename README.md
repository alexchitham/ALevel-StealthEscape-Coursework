# ALevel-StealthEscape-Coursework
Created a 3/4 view stealth game in Unity as part of my A-level Computer Science coursework. The goal of the game is to get from the start to the end having collected the loot. The player must avoid guards and fixed cameras that move and rotate in a set motion, and by using ray tracing, it formed a moving FOV for the player to avoid. All the animations, including cameras, guards and the player were designed by me in a pixel art editing software called Piskel, and used the code that controlled movement to cycle between animations. OO techniques used throughout using C#. 

All the C# source files for my project are in this repository.
